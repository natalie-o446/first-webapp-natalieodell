                <h1>The Team</h1>
                <p> We have many great athletes here at CCA. As of this season (spring 2025) there have been several school records that were broken by our competing athletes. We have also set a new record for how many athletes earned a new personal best this year as well. If you would like to join, come check us out! Practices are in the afternoon from 3:45PM to 5:45PM. We have different events such as Long Distance, Middle Distance, Short Distance/Sprints, Shotup and Discuss, Long Jump, Pole Vault, Triple Jump, and High Jump that are very welcoming squads who would be happy to have you!</p>
